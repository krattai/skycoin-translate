Fiber

The infinitely-scalable and highly customizable parallel peer-chain architecture of the Skycoin platform. Fiber is a better-than-blockchain solution, which is transformational in the way that it solves existing problems with distributed ledger technology.

Fiber is the foundation of “cryptocurrency 3.0”, an infinitely scalable network of blockchains laid side-by-side, like strands. Each project hosted on Fiber gets its own fully customizable, private blockchain capable of Visa-like speeds. Each strand added to Fiber strengthens the whole network and constructs the fabric of the entire ecosystem.

Skycoin Fiber does not compete with first and second generation cryptocurrency architectures, it replaces them. From fledgling blockchain projects to enterprises looking for solutions, Fiber is the answer.
